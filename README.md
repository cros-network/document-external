# Â© Cros

## Introduction

The Metaverse is expected to witness meteoric growth to be a multi-trillion dollar economy, with advertising and commerce fueling this growth, yet till today the metaverse has no infrastructure or standards for advertising and consumer economy.

This is where CROS comes in, we are building the infrastructure technology layer to connect metaverse with advertisers, in a fully decentralized and automated process.

Cros primarily provides cutting-edge technology infrastructure for the metaverses and brands to power advertising and the consumer economy in the metaverse. Similar to how Shopify has built the eCommerce infrastructure to enable brands to sell to customers.

Cros is a web3 platform and protocol, using blockchain smart contracts, built by the engineering leadership from Google Microsoft, Cisco, and others, who have a vision of building the metaverse better, faster and safer.

## **Mission**

Cros is making multi-trillion dollar Metaverse economy work for all; eCommerce, Landowners, Creators, Developers, and many more.&#x20;

## Market

Cros has rightly positioned itself in the untapped rapidly growing Metaverse and Advertising market, which is a highly fragmented massive market with no market leader.&#x20;

## Revenue

Cros collects a small fee of 5-10% over Ads & NFTs revenue transactions within the platform. More information can be found in our Fees section.&#x20;



**Note: Cros is currently in its early phases of development, the Whitepaper content could keep changing.**
