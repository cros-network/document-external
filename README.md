## Introduction

The gaming ecosystem is expected to witness meteoric growth to be a multi-trillion dollar economy, with advertising and commerce fueling this growth, yet most of the popular gaming platforms have no infrastructure or standards for advertising and consumer economy except for custom built in-game economy.

This is where CROS comes in, we are building the infrastructure technology layer to connect game developers with advertisers, in a fully decentralized and automated process.

Cros primarily provides cutting-edge technology infrastructure for the gaming platforms and brands to power advertising and the consumer economy. Similar to how Shopify has built the eCommerce infrastructure to enable brands to sell to customers.

Cros is a distributed platform and apps built on an open protocol and using blockchain smart contracts. It is being built by the engineering leaders  from Google Microsoft, Cisco, and others, who have a vision of building an open, better and transparent advertising network connecting all gaming platforms.

## **Mission**

Cros is making multi-trillion dollar gaming economy work for all; , Creators, Game Developers, Gaming Platforms, Brands and many more.
