# üè® Publishing

## Publisher

The publishers on metaverses are people and entities that control the digital space where the users can interact with the content and brands. Such digital spaces can be land parcels with built environment such as art galleries, cafes, stadiums or these could be games, contest and events in metaverses such as Decentraland and The Sandbox. Based on the specific aspects of these platforms, each space can have a virtual ad-slot where content (a form of media) can be played or displayed for a set period.&#x20;

Advertising can be an additional revenue channel for the owners of the virtual scarce goods (such as land) but the value generation will be bounded by rich & immersive experiences that can be created for the users.&#x20;

### Creator

These are the designers and modelers who are creating built environment on the metaverse \*lands\* and building those immersive content-rich experiences that users crave for.  Traditionally, this group is seen as \*for-hire\* for a specific project on behest of the publishers. As such, they have not been part of the advertising value chain.&#x20;

### Developer

These are the engineers & builders who work alongside the creators to build interactive virtual experiences (games, goal-driven quests, even a simple store walk-in experience) that then lead to users engaging with contents and brands. Traditionally, this group has also not been part of the centralized advertising value chain.&#x20;
