# Cros Governance Council

The Cros Governance Council is a body with the authority to make decisions on a variety of governance issues. The Governance Council's early members will be limited to trusted individuals and organizations to ensure its trustworthiness. This decision was made to allow the protocol to be improved quickly during the platform development and stabilization stages. However, as the platform develops, more participants and 24 token holders will be able to join in the governance process. The Cros Governance Council will be composed of members of the Cros Governance Council and the Chairman.
