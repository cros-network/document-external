Publishers are entitled to receive the settlement against the impressions on the ads campaign of advertisers published on the assets over their land parcels. After a small platform fee of around 5-10% of the total settlement, the total remaining amount will be transferred to the publisher's escrow account. \
Similarly, for creators, the total amount from selling or renting NFTs will be credited to the creator's escrow account after the platform fees of 5-10% of the settlement fund. \
The money from the user's escrow account can be always cashed out.
