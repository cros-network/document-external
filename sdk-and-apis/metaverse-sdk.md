# Metaverse SDK

Cros provides Software Development Kit (SDK) for content creators and publishers to help them design, build and deploy advertising enabled assets on metaverse. The SDK is built in layers of abstraction over the capabilities provided by native metaverse platforms such as Decentraland. It exposes objects such as `context` and `capabilities` that are used to differentiate between the generic and specific (to a metaverse) functionality exposed through the SDK.

The following diagram shows the layer of abstraction (specification to generalization) that SDK provides for publishers, developers & creators:
