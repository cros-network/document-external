# Open  APIs

## Ad Bidding APIs

Cros provides bidding APIs for third-party demand partners to compete for the ad-inventory across metaverses in a set of auctions. The API will also include reporting, traffic and billing information in future.&#x20;

The bidding APIs collect bid responses from third party demand partners which are channeled back to the auction engine. Based on the ad-inventory and other parameters, an appropriate auction format is chosen, and a unified auction is run for all the bid responses to determine the most efficient allocation of inventory.&#x20;

Ad Bidding APIs are designed keeping IAB certified version of the OpenRTB spec in mind making it easy to integrate with DSPs compliant with OpenRTB specification.&#x20;

## Ad Serve APIs

All deployed Cros ad-assets on different metaverses fetch the advertisements through an ad-serving API. This API is bundled in different configurations based on ad-media, ad-packaging for a native experience on a metaverse and other parameters.&#x20;

The Ad server APIs make it possible for native experiences to be built by each metaverse such that Cros Ad platform serves the most appropriate ad-media based on environment and user context while the display and interaction is controlled by the metaverse - which could be through a device or any other medium.&#x20;
