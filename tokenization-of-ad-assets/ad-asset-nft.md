# Ad Asset NFT

Whatever campaigns advertisers create, they wish to display it on some asset which is situated on the land parcel owned by publishers. \
If there's no ad asset, brand advertisements cannot be displayed to targeted audiences.\
To make a variety of ad assets available for publishers so that they can choose as per their space and appearance, Cros provided a platform to creators to develop these ad asset NFTs. Publishers can either purchase  user generated NFTs or take it on lease for required time and place it on their property to run the ads of advertisers and earn money against the impressions. \
Ad asset NFTs are not necessarily traded between creators and publishers, but any other user interested in passive income can purchase from creators and then either sell or rent it to publishers. \


* If the token owner owns a land like asset in a metaverse, he/she can deploy the ad-asset and earn income from the displayed ads.&#x20;
* The token owner can also lease out her Ad Asset NFT to other landowners and earn a portion of the income from the displayed ads.
