# Brand NFTs

The advertisers can also choose to create a NFT of their product or brand and launch that through the brand advertisement. Say, for example, a famous brand of sneakers, while designing an advertisement campaign for a new line of shoes, can also create a NFT collection for the same sneaker shoes. &#x20;

Cros designs these brand NFT collections such that the consumer watching the advertisement can  mint & buy the digital NFT of the advertised product from any of the advertisement assets across the different metaverses using an experience native to that metaverse (example, a 2-minute game quest which is an advertisement and an NFT promotion and a \*shop & mint\* interface).&#x20;
